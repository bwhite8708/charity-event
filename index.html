    <section id="about">
      Join us in the freedom fight for exotic cats!  They were designed to live free; not in cages.  The number one cause of abuse is the practice of posing with big cats and their cubs because it creates a flood of discarded cats that serve no conservation value and end up dead or in conditions that are often even worse.  You will find us to be completely transparent in our values, care of our 60+ wild cats, and finances.

    <h1>  Big Cat Rescue Collaborates with Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium to Bring a Jaguar and Leopard to the Sanctuary.</h1>
      <p> December 13, 2017

 For the second time in less than a week, Big Cat Rescue has new cats arriving at the sanctuary!

 We are taking in and will be the permanent home for an 11-year- old male jaguar named Manny and a 16-year- old female leopard named Nat from Omaha’s AZA-accredited Henry Doorly Zoo. What a December to Remember for the sanctuary!

 Jamie and her team of Big Cat Rescuers are driving the cats to the sanctuary in our new Dodge van that we just purr-chased thanks to the incredible generosity of donors like you who read about our desperate need for a new van in our July annual appeal letter! We are so very grateful to have this van that is not only bringing Manny and Nat to their forever home right now but will help us rescue many precious exotic cats for years to come!

 Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska is constructing expansive new natural habitats for many of their big cats and other animals. For this progress to occur, some of their current exhibits are being replaced. When Big Cat Rescue learned that the zoo was searching for a GFAS-accredited sanctuary to rehome Manny the jaguar and Nat the leopard, we immediately offered to take them.</p>
